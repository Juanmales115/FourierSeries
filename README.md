# FourierSeries
Python code to visualize the approximation of a function using a finite Fourier series, showing convergence as more terms are added. It also includes a function to make any function periodic for Fourier series calculations. However, the function doesnâ€™t need to be periodic. Note that the animar_fourier code only allows creating GIFs.
