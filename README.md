# FourierSeries

Python code to visualize the approximation of a function using a finite Fourier series, showing convergence as more terms are added. It also includes a function to make any function periodic for Fourier series calculations. However, the function doesnâ€™t need to be periodic. Note that the animar_fourier code only allows creating GIFs.

## Content

- Output: Where all GIFs will be created.
- src: Where the code of all functions is.
- Example: One example of ussage with three different functions.

## Update

Added a new function: "animate_frejer". Frejer sums are the aritmetic mean of Fourier sums, which resulted to be more precise. This new function does same as the "animate_fourier" but with Frejer sums.
